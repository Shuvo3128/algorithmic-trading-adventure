lgorithmic Trading Adventure – Golden Cross Strategy
Project Overview

This project implements a class-based algorithmic trading simulator using Python.
The system analyzes historical stock market data and automatically makes buy and sell decisions based on the Golden Cross strategy, while strictly respecting a fixed investment budget of $5000.

The project uses historical data (paper trading) and evaluates the strategy by calculating the final profit or loss, along with a visual graph showing price trends and trading signals.
